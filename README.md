# 🛒 Online Retail Analysis Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive **B2B sales performance and customer behavior analysis** using real-world retail transaction data from a UK-based online store. It integrates deep data cleaning (in Python) with rich business insights (in Tableau), enabling decision-makers to understand key sales drivers, customer segments, and churn trends.
